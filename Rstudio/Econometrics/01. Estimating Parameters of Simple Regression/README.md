## General Model

Hello, I'm Niken Hapsari Agustiningrum. I have utmost interest in actuarial science, statistics, data science fields. Here I show you some of my works. My projects are mostly made with the help of R, Python, and SQL. The analyzes that I use are all based on statistics, mathematics, and probability. If you have any questions or wanting to collaborate with me, you can reach me through e-mail at [hpsri.niken@gmail.com](mailto:hpsri.niken@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikenhapsari/). I'll be glad to works with other collaborators.
