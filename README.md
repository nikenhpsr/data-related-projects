## Who am I?

Hello, I'm Niken Hapsari Agustiningrum. I have utmost interest in actuarial science, statistics, data science fields. Here I show you some of my works. My projects are mostly made with the help of R, Python, and SQL. The analyzes that I use are all based on statistics, mathematics, and probability. If you have any questions or wanting to collaborate with me, you can reach me through e-mail at [hpsri.niken@gmail.com](mailto:hpsri.niken@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikenhapsari/). I'll be glad to works with other collaborators.

## Python Based Projects

### [GPV Reserve of Endowment Policy with Monthly and Anually Valuation](./Python/GPV%20Reserve%20of%20Endowment%20Policy%20with%20Monthly%20and%20Anually%20Valuation/GPV_Reserve.ipynb)

This project aim to calculate GPV Reserve for Endowment Policy based on Monthly and Annualy Valuation. The output of this code are gross premium, gpv reserve for each year, and plots of gross premium, gpv reserves, policy fee, admin fee, and many more.

_More projects will be uploaded soon_

## R Based Projects

### [Econometric Works](./Rstudio/Econometrics/)

#### [Predicting Quantitative Sales Outcome on The Basis of Youtube Advertising Budget](./Rstudio/Econometrics/01.%20Simple%20Regression%20Analysis/Simple_Linear_Regression_Analysis.ipynb)

This project aim to predict quantitative outcome of Sales ( _y_ ) on the basis of one single variable, Youtube advertising ( _x_ ). And thus evaluate the model whether linear regression suitable for this data or not. You can read more detail [in here](./Rstudio/Econometrics/01.%20Simple%20Regression%20Analysis/Simple_Linear_Regression_Analysis.ipynb)

#### [Predict Body Weight Based on Height, Head Circumference, Bust, Right Thigh Circumference, Right Arm Circumference, and Waist Circumference ](./Rstudio/Econometrics/02.%20Multiple%20Regression%20Analysis/Multiple_Linear_Regression_Analysis_in_R.ipynb)

This project aim to predict quantitative outcome of body weight ( _y_ ) on the basis of several variables such as height, head circumference, bust, right thigh circumference, right arm circumference, and waist circumference. And thus evaluate the model whether linear regression suitable for this data or not. You can read more detail [in here](./Rstudio/Econometrics/02.%20Multiple%20Regression%20Analysis/Multiple_Linear_Regression_Analysis_in_R.ipynb)
